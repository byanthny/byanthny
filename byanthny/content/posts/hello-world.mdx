This is my first blog post. I built this blog to share thoughts, notes, and whatever else comes to mind.

## How it works

Posts are written in markdown files and committed to git. Simple as that.

### Frontmatter

Each post has frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2026-01-15"
description: "A short description."
---
```

### Markdown features

You can use all the usual markdown:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks
- Lists
- And more

That's it for now.
