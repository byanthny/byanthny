Got the Adafruit RP2040 Macropad kit assembled and working with Rust.

## The Hardware

The kit comes with:
- RP2040 microcontroller
- 3x4 mechanical key switches
- Rotary encoder
- Small OLED display

## Rust Setup

Using the `rp2040-hal` crate for hardware abstraction. The embassy framework makes async embedded rust pretty nice to work with.

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use rp2040_hal as hal;
```

More updates to come as I build out the firmware.
