marking the start of the site

welcome to my website. consider it just a personal archive of sorts, you'll find all the useful information here about what i've worked on or anything i think relevant, in the space of my career.

this is not a flashy showcase of my skills, rather a documentation site of well, me. i might make another site later for that.

enjoy, do with it what you wish. i plan on making a custom theme later.
